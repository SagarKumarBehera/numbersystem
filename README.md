<h1>A brief description of the project</h1>
<h3>Code Written in index.js</h3>
<p> Code are for Even and Odd Numbers in the below array 
const numbers = [3, 7, 2, 15, 9, 20, 5, 14, 12, 1, 8, 11, 6, 19, 4, 10, 17, 13, 16, 18,];
where we get even number as 2,20,14,12,8,6,4,10,16,18 as an output.</p>
<h3>Code Written in app.js</h3>
<p>finds all the prime numbers from the given array:
const numbers = [19, 23, 4, 16, 28, 13, 31, 8, 29, 14, 6, 35, 2, 11, 17, 5, 9, 27, 12, 30,];
Calculate Maximum, Minimum, and Sum and it Creates a new array called primeArray that stores all the prime numbers found.
It tells the maximum and minimum number in the primeArray and it also Calculate the sum of all numbers in the primeArray.</p>
